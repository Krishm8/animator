  {
    'name': 'Mercury',
    'image': 'assets/images/marcury.png',
    'description': 'Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It has a very thin atmosphere, causing extreme temperature variations between day and night. Mercury is also the smallest planet in our Solar System.',
    'newDescription': 'Mercury has no moons or rings and is known for its swift orbit around the Sun, taking only 88 Earth days to complete one revolution.',

  },
  {
    'name': 'Venus',
    'image': 'assets/images/venus.png',
    'description': 'Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size and structure to Earth. It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.',
    'newDescription': 'Venus rotates very slowly on its axis and in the opposite direction to most planets, meaning it has very long days and nights.',

  },
  {
    'name': 'Earth',
    'image': 'assets/images/earth1.png',
    'description': 'Earth is the third planet from the Sun and our home. It is the only planet known to support life, with a diverse range of ecosystems. Earth has a surface composed of 71% water and 29% land.',
    'newDescription': 'Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon, which significantly affects tides and has been a focus of human exploration.',

  {
    'name': 'Mars',
    'image': 'assets/images/mars.png',
    'description': 'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance. Mars has the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and a canyon system, Valles Marineris, that dwarfs the Grand Canyon.',
    'newDescription': 'Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and is a primary target in the search for past or present life beyond Earth.',
    'img': 'assets/images/mars.png'
  },
  {
    'name': 'Jupiter',
    'image': 'assets/images/jupiter.png',
    'description': 'Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System and is known for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and at least 79 moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System.',
    'newDescription': 'Jupiterâ€™s fast rotation causes it to have an oblate shape, meaning it is flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator.',
    'img': 'assets/images/jupiter.png'
  },
  {
    'name': 'Neptune',
    'image': 'assets/images/Neptune.png',
    'description': 'Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It is known for its deep blue color and strong winds, with some of the fastest wind speeds in the Solar System. Neptune has a prominent moon, Triton, which is geologically active.',
    'newDescription': 'Neptune has 14 known moons and a faint ring system, and it was the first planet located through mathematical predictions rather than direct observation.',
